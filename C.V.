RESEARCH EXPERIENCE 
Contreras Lab Dr. Lydia Contreras University of Texas in Austin, McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering. 
Research: Understanding the role of RNA oxidation in the response to low doses of irradiation within members of the human microbiota and developing molecular tools to detect oxidative damage. This has involved precise measurements of cells using molecular methods as well as computational methods to parse large RNA-seq data sets.
Presentations: Chip and Dip Departmental Talk: Irradiation and RNA Oxidation (2017) Understanding the Effects of Physiologically Relevant Doses of Ionizing Radiation on Bacteria, Using the Model Organisms Shewanella oneidensis (2019)
Posters: DTRA Life Sciences Division: Characterizing the Impact of Sub-Lethal Doses of Ionizing Radiation on the Microbiota (2018)
American Society of Microbiology: Characterization of the Transcriptional Response to Sub-lethal Ionizing (2019)
DTRA Life Sciences Division: Sub-lethal Ionizing Radiation Exposure Elicits a Transcriptional Response from B. thetaiotaomicron (2019)

Yatsenko Lab Dr. Alexander Yatsenko Magee Women’s Research Institute. Researching genetic causes for male infertility through the application of NES across large numbers of patients and the development of infertility models within mice (Spring 2015-Summer 2016)
	Papers: Tas E, Sebastian J, Madan-Khetarpal S, Sweet P, Yatsenko AN, Pollock N, Rajkovic A, Schneck FX, Yatsenko SA, Witchel SF. 2017. Familial deletion of the HOXA gene cluster associated with Hand–Foot–Genital syndrome and phenotypic variability. Am J Med Genet Part A 173A:221–224.
Presentations: HHMI Symposium Poster Fair: Identifying Mouse Model Candidate Genes to Better Understand Spermatogenesis 

Peebles Lab Dr. Craig Peebles Department of Biological Sciences researching RNA expression in phages (Fall 2014-Fall 2015)
Research: Independently characterize the expression of novel RNA structures within the bacteriophage Pio. My research involved E. coli cloning project in which unannotated regions of phage Pio genome were expressed in E. coli and M.smegmatis to determine if novel RNA structures, potentially similar to tRNA’s, were present within the phages genome.

●	Science 2014 Undergraduate Poster Fair (Fall 2014) Quest for Novel 
●	HHMI Fellowship Symposium (Summer 2014) The Question for Novel RNA’s in the Phage Genome 

Teaching and Communication Experience
	They Blinded Me with Science: Host/DJ
•	A weekly radio show on KTXS that delivers on-air interviews with graduate students and other University of Texas researchers to the Austin community
Welch Summer Scholar Program: Mentor (2018, 2019)
•	WSSP grants highly motivated high school students a chance to experience science first hand. As a mentor I designed, and guided, a 5-week research plan that allowed the WSSP fellow to learn bench skills, experimental design and science communication.
Howard Hughes Medical Institute Summer Fellowship Mentor/Mentee Workshop (Summer 2013)
•	One-on-one two week intensive on basic lab techniques including PCR, transformations, culture growth, sequencing, and transfections
